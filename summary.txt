Wireshark Capture Project - Summary of Findings (Template)
---------------------------------------------------------

Filename: synthetic_capture.pcap
Local path: Wireshark_Capture_Project/synthetic_capture.pcap

1) Capture steps performed:
- Interface used: <your active interface>
- Duration: ~60 seconds
- Actions to generate traffic: Browsed example.com, pinged 8.8.8.8, etc.

2) Filters applied in Wireshark:
- icmp
- dns
- http
- tcp.port == 80

3) Observed protocols (identify at least 3):
- Protocol 1: e.g., ICMP  (count: <n>)
- Protocol 2: e.g., DNS   (count: <n>)
- Protocol 3: e.g., TCP/HTTP (count: <n>)

4) Notable packets (include packet number and brief details):
- Packet # : ICMP Echo (ping) from <src> to <dst>, length X bytes
- Packet # : DNS Query for example.com from <src> to <dst>, QR=0
- Packet # : TCP SYN from <src> to <dst>:80 (start of TCP handshake)
- Packet # : HTTP GET request to / from <src> to <dst>

5) Evidence and screenshots:
- Place screenshots of filtered views into evidence_screenshots/ (e.g., icmp_filter.png, dns_filter.png, http_filter.png).

6) Conclusion and recommendations:
- e.g., No suspicious traffic observed. Recommend monitoring and using HTTPS for web traffic, etc.
