This file is a placeholder because this environment cannot capture live network traffic.
Follow these steps on your Windows/Linux/Mac computer to create the real capture and save it as 'synthetic_capture.pcap' inside this folder.

Option A: Wireshark (GUI)
1. Open Wireshark.
2. Select your active network interface (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
3. Click Start to begin capturing.
4. Generate traffic: open a website (http://example.com), and open a terminal and run: ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 (or 'ping 8.8.8.8' on Windows).
5. After ~60 seconds, click Stop.
6. File -> Save As -> choose "pcap" or "pcapng" and name it 'synthetic_capture.pcap' and save it into this project folder.
7. Take screenshots of the Wireshark window showing the filters you used and save them into the evidence_screenshots folder.

Option B: tshark (CLI)
# Linux / macOS / Windows (with tshark installed):
tshark -i 1 -a duration:60 -w synthetic_capture.pcap

# Replace -i 1 with the correct interface number shown by `tshark -D`.
# To capture only HTTP and DNS packets:
tshark -i 1 -a duration:60 -f "port 80 or port 53" -w synthetic_capture.pcap
